CLIENT COMMUNICATION
================================================================================

Key points to emphasize:

1. "Nothing was deleted - everything was upgraded!"
   - Time Tracking → Man-Hour Tracking (✅ Now with full content)
   - Team Chat → Communication (✅ Structure ready, adding chat interface)
   - File Sharing → Documents & Drawings (✅ Structure ready, adding file management)
   - Reports → Multiple specialized dashboards (✅ Earned Value already complete)

2. "Old features are now industry-specific"
   - Generic time tracking → Construction man-hour tracking
   - Generic file sharing → Drawing & document management
   - Generic chat → Project communication with RFIs
   - Generic reports → EVM, CPI/SPI, Budget analytics

3. "Same functionality, better organization"
   - Everything is still accessible
   - Now organized by construction workflow
   - More powerful with construction-specific features
   - Better integrated with budget and cost control

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review manhour-tracking.html to see the level of detail added
2. Apply similar level of detail to:
   - communication.html
   - documents-drawings.html
   - department-analytics.html
3. Update remaining analytics pages:
   - cost-control.html
   - budget-tracking.html
